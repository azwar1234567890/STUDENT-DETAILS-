Features
1.Add Student: Insert new student records.
2.Update Student: Update existing student records.
3.Edit Student: Modify the details of a student.
4.Delete Student: Remove student records.
5.Search Student: Search student records by name, subject, or class.
6.Sort by ID: Ascending/descending sorting by student ID.
7.Filter: Filter records by student name, subject, or class.


Technologies Used
1.ASP.NET Web Forms (C#)
2.SQL Server (Database)
3.ADO.NET (for database communication)
4.Stored Procedures (for database operations)
5.HTML/CSS (for front-end form)


Project Setup
1. Clone the Repository.
2. Database Setup
        Create a database in SQL Server named StudentDB.
        Use the Database Schema section below to create the required table.
        Use the Stored Procedures section to create the required stored procedures.
3. Configure Connection String
        Update the connection string in the Web.config file.
4. Build and Run
        Open the project in Visual Studio.
        Build the solution and run the project. You should be able to interact with the form to manage student data.

   
How to Run the Project
1.Set up the SQL Server database and stored procedures.
2.Clone the project and update the connection string in the Web.config file.
3.Run the project in Visual Studio, which will launch the ASP.NET web application.
4.Use the form to perform CRUD operations and search/sort/filter student records.
5.This project provides a full demonstration of building an ASP.NET Web Forms application with SQL Server as the back-end and C# for business logic and database interaction.
